# Oxisense

Oxisense is a microcontroller-based wearable designed to measure the user’s heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) in real time. The project was developed as part of the master-level course Microcontroller (CM2036), which focuses on C programming, embedded hardware design, and real-time data processing in microcontroller systems.

The goal of Oxisense was to create a simple, portable, and reliable solution for monitoring vital signs in everyday life, during workouts, or as support for personal health tracking. As part of the project, the team also explored the concept of a companion mobile app to extend functionality and enable long-term data visualization.

## Features

* Heart rate measurement (BPM)
* Oxygen saturation measurement (SpO2)
* Real-time value display via LED display
* Microcontroller-driven data collection and signal processing

## Technology

* Microcontroller (RISC-V)
* Pulse and SpO2 sensor (MAX30102)
* Embedded C programming
* Swift-code
* Lightweight hardware design for wearable integration
* Bluetooth
* SD-Card

## Project Status

Oxisense is a completed student project. The final prototype implements real-time pulse and SpO2 monitoring with on-device processing and display. The repository documents the finished hardware design, firmware, and initial groundwork for future extensions such as wireless communication and a dedicated mobile application.
