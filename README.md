# Oxisense

OxiSense is a microcontroller-based wearable system designed to measure heart rate (BPM) and oxygen saturation (SpO₂) in real time. The project was developed as part of the master-level course Microcontroller (CM2036), with a strong focus on C programming, embedded hardware design, and real-time data processing.

The goal of OxiSense was to create a simple, portable, and reliable solution for monitoring vital signs in everyday use and during physical activity. The system is complemented by a custom iOS application developed in Xcode using Swift, which communicates with the device over Bluetooth, retrieves logged sensor data, and visualizes BPM and SpO₂ measurements for long-term analysis.

## Features

* Heart rate measurement (BPM)
* Oxygen saturation measurement (SpO2)
* Real-time value display via LED display
* Microcontroller-driven data collection and signal processing

## Technology

* Microcontroller (RISC-V)
* Pulse and SpO2 sensor (MAX30102)
* Embedded C programming
* Swift-code
* Lightweight hardware design for wearable integration
* Bluetooth
* SD-Card

## Project Status

Oxisense is a completed student project. The final prototype implements real-time pulse and SpO2 monitoring with on-device processing and display. The repository documents the finished hardware design, firmware, and initial groundwork for future extensions such as wireless communication and a dedicated mobile application.
